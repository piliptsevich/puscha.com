        <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Belovezhskaya Pushcha National Park is a national park within parts of the Brest Region (Kamyanyets and Pruzhany districts) and Grodno Region (Svislach district) in Belarus adjacent to the border with Poland. It is a preserved part of the UNESCO WHS Białowieża Forest, Belarus, Poland, the last primaeval forest fragment of the Europe's woodlands, that once stretched across the European Plain. It is home to a large population of European bison the continent's heaviest land animals. The border between the two countries runs through the forest, the Białowieża National Park is on the Polish side of the border. Within the forest since May 2015, there is a visa-free regime for hikers and cyclists at the border crossing Pererov-Białowieża.</p>
          
        <h2>History</h2>
          <p>The entire area of northeastern Europe was originally covered by ancient woodland similar to that of the Białowieża Forest. Until about the 14th century, travel through the woodland was limited to river routes; roads and bridges appeared much later. Limited hunting rights were granted throughout the forest in the 14th century. In the 15th century the forest became a property of king Władysław II Jagiełło. A wooden manor in Białowieża became his refuge during a plague pandemic in 1426. The first recorded piece of legislation on the protection of the forest dates to 1538, when a document issued by Sigismund I instituted the death penalty for poaching a bison. The King also built a new wooden hunting manor in a village of Białowieża, which became the namesake for the whole complex. Since Białowieża means the "white tower", the corresponding Puszcza Białowieska translates as the "forest of the white tower". The Tower of Kamyenyets on the Belarusian side, built of red brick, is also referred to as the White Tower (Belaya Vezha) even though it was never white, perhaps taking the name from the pushcha.</p>

          <p>The forest was declared a hunting reserve in 1541 to protect bison. In 1557, the forest charter was issued, under which a special board was established to examine forest usage. In 1639, King Vladislaus IV issued the "Białowieża royal forest decree" (Ordynacja Puszczy J.K. Mości leśnictwa Białowieskiego). The document freed all peasants living in the forest in exchange for their service as osocznicy, or royal foresters. They were also freed of taxes in exchange for taking care of the forest. The forest was divided onto 12 triangular areas (straże) with a centre in Białowieża.</p>

          <p>Until the reign of King John II Casimir, the forest was mostly unpopulated. However, in the late 17th century, several small villages were established for development of local iron-ore deposits and tar production. The villages were populated with settlers from Masovia and Podlaskie and many of them still exist.</p>

          <p>After the Partitions of Poland, Tsar Paul I turned all the foresters into serfs and handed them over to various Russian aristocrats and generals along with the parts of forest where they lived. Also, a large number of hunters were able to enter the forest, as all protection was abolished. Following this, the number of bison fell from more than 500 to fewer than 200 in 15 years. However, in 1801, Tsar Alexander I reintroduced the reserve and hired a small number of peasants to protect the animals, and by the 1830s there were 700 bison. However, most of the foresters (500 out of 502) took part in the November Uprising of 1830–31, and their posts were abolished, leading to a breakdown of protection.</p>

          <p>Tsar Alexander II visited the forest in 1860 and decided to re-establish the protection of bison. Following his orders, locals killed all predators: wolves, boars and lynx. Between 1888 and 1917, the Russian tsars owned all of primaeval forest, which became the royal hunting reserve. The tsars sent bison as gifts to various European capitals, while at the same time populating the forest with deer, elk and other animals imported from around the empire. The last major tsarist hunt took place in 1912.</p>



  <!--         <p>The National Park is situated in the north-east part of Poland, in podlaskie voivodeship. The Park covers the central part of Białowieża Forest. </p>
          <p>Its beginnings can be traced back to 1921, when the “Reserve” forestry was created at the place currently occupied by the Park. In 1932, the „Reserve” forestry was transformed into „National Park in Białowieża”. In 1947 the unit was reinstated as Białowieża National Park, and under the same name functions until today. </p>
          <p>The Park covers the area of 10 517,27 ha, which constitutes 1/6 of the Polish part of Białowieża Forest. 6059,27 ha is under strict protection, 4104,63 ha is under active protection, and landscape protection covers the area of 353,37 ha. There has been a protection zone created around the Park which covers the state commercial forest having an area of 3224,26 ha.</p>
          <p>The park comprises 3 administrative units: Orłówka Protective Unit, Hwoźna Protective Unit and the European Bison Breeding Center (covering three breeding reserves and European Bison Show Reserve).</p>
          <p>Białowieża National Park protects the best preserved fragment of Białowieża Forest – last natural forest at the European Lowland Area, having the primaeval character, identical with the one which covered the area of deciduous and coniferous forests years ago. The characteristic feature of the park is its biological diversity. The Park comprises, inter alia, 809 vascular plants species, over 3 thousand cryptogams and fungi species, almost 200 moss species and 283 lichen species. There have been more than 8 thousand invertebrates species, approximately 120 species of breeding birds and 52 mammal species. Old, primaeval forest stands in Białowieża National Park are characterized by large amounts of  deadwood at the various stage of disintegration, and by the presence of typical natural forest species. Among the birds to be fund in the park one can identify e.g.: Eurasian pygmy-owl, three-toed and white-backed woodpecker; the beetles – black fir sawyer, Osmoderma eremita, Pytho kolwensis; and the butterflies  – Aglia Tau, moorland clouded yellow.</p>
          <p>Apart from Białowieża Forest, many of the aforementioned species can be identified only in few places worldwide.</p>
          <p>European bison – the biggest European land mammal – is the symbol of the Park. Białowieża Forest became last mainstay for the lowland European bison. The process of its reinstatement, bringing it back to nature started right there. At present, Białowieża Forest comprises the largest free-living population of European bison in the world. There are approximately 500 European bison living in the Polish part of Białowieża Forest.</p>
          <p>Białowieża National Park is the only Polish natural property designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage site. The Park is the most important – central zone of Białowieża Forest Biosphere Reserve.</p>
          <p>The area of the Park is interesting with a regard to the historic and cultural aspects. Park Palace, covering the area of 50 ha is one of the Park structures. The Palace was founded between 19th and 20 century in the close vicinity of the Tsar’s palace, constructed in years 1889 – 1894. The Park in the English style, also known as a landscape style, was designed by the famous Polish designer – Walery Kronenberg. The area of the Park comprises, inter alia the oldest building in Białowieża  – the wooden manor-house from 1845, and the oldest monument in Białowieża – sandstone obelisk, commemorating the hunting of August III from Saxon dynasty, which took place in 1752. The Park Palace is registered in podlaskie voivodeship register on list of monuments. The Park is protected with a regard to the historical origins of the park having a national range. There is also a complex of historical buildings situated within the Park area. </p>     -->

      <div class="about-nature">
        <h2>20th century wartime damages and restoration</h2>

        <p>During World War I the forest suffered heavy losses. The German army seized the area in August 1915 and started to hunt the animals. During three years of German occupation, 200 kilometres (124 miles) of railway tracks were laid in the forest to support the local industry. Three lumber mills were built, in Hajnówka, Białowieża and Gródek. Up to 25 September 1915, at least 200 bison were killed, and an order was issued forbidding hunting in the reserve. However, German soldiers, poachers and Soviet marauders continued the slaughter until February 1919 when the area was captured by the Polish army. The last bison had been killed just a month earlier. Thousands of deer and wild boar had also been shot.</p>

        <p>After the Polish–Soviet War in 1921, the core of the forest was declared a National Reserve. In 1923, Professor Józef Paczoski, a pioneer of the science of phytosociology, became a scientific manager of the forest reserves in the Białowieża Forest. He carried out detailed studies of the structure of forest vegetation there.[19][20][21]</p>

        <p>In 1923 it was known that only 54 bison survived in zoos all around the world, none of them in Poland. In 1929, a small herd of four was bought by the Polish state from various zoos and from the Western Caucasus (where the bison was to become extinct just a few years; these animals were of the slightly different Caucasian subspecies (Bison bonasus caucasicus). Most of the forest was declared a national park in 1932.</p>

        <p>The reintroduction proved successful, and in 1939 there were 16 bison in Białowieża National Park. Two of them, from the zoo in Pszczyna, were descendants of a pair from the forest given to the Duke of Pszczyna by Tsar Alexander II in 1865.</p>

        <p>In 1939 the local inhabitants of Polish ethnicity were deported to remote areas of the Soviet Union and replaced by Soviet forest workers. In 1941 the forest was occupied by Germans and the Russian Soviet inhabitants were also expelled. Hermann Göring planned to create the largest hunting reserve in the world there. After July 1941 the forest became a refuge for both Polish and Soviet partisans and Nazi authorities organised mass executions. A few graves of people who were killed by the Gestapo can still be seen in the forest. In July 1944 the area was liberated by the Red Army. Withdrawing Wehrmacht troops demolished the historic Białowieża hunting manor.</p>

        <p>After the war, part of the forest was divided between Poland and the Belarusian SSR of the Soviet Union. The Soviet part was put under public administration while Poland reopened the Białowieża National Park in 1947.</p>

        <p>Belovezhskaya Pushcha was protected under Decision No. 657 of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union, 9 October 1944; Order No. 2252-P of the USSR Council of Ministers, 9 August 1957; and Decree No. 352 of the Byelorussian SSR Council of Ministers, 16 September 1991.</p>

        <p>In 1991, the Belavezha Accords, the decision to dissolve the Soviet Union, were signed at a meeting in the Belarusian part of the reserve by the leaders of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus.</p>

         <!--  <p>Today, Belovezhskaya Pushcha is a forest complex covering the area of 150 000 ha located on the both sides of the Polish-Belorussian border. Western part, situated in Poland, covers the area of 62 500 ha; eastern part, situated in Belarus, covers the area of 87 500 ha.</p>
          <p>Luckily, the Belovezhskaya Pushcha was protected as a royal hunting ground, and in 19th century as a hunting ground of Tsar, and due to that fact was under special protection – e.g. it was not subject to so called “colonization”, meaning tree cutting and change of the forest areas into agricultural and settlement areas.</p>
          <p>Due to the aforementioned fact, from the beginning of the 20th century forests of a natural origin were preserved, and in the forests the greatest European animal was saved – European bison. First illegal tree cutting can be traced back to the I World War period, when, at the beginning of 1919, last bison died.</p>
          <p>The origins of the National Park are connected with the expedition of a group of scientists led by prof. Władysław Szafer in April 1919 to Białowieża, who travelled with a purpose of checking whether any European bisons remained in the Białowieża Forest area. Although there were no bisons left, the expedition ended with a decision to undertake the efforts to protect the fragment of the primeval forest in a form of the national park. The efforts undertaken brought the expected result in the creation, on the 29th of December 1921, of the “Reserve” forestry, changed in 1924 into forest inspectorate under the same name. In 1932  the „Reserve” forest inspectorate was changed into "National Park in  Białowieża" having the area of 4693,24 ha covered by strict protection. In 1947 the aforementioned unit was reinstated as Białowieża National Park covering the area of 4716 ha. In 1996 the park area was enlarged by 10 501,95 ha. It shall be also added that natural values and appropriate forms of protection fulfilled, from the very beginning (from 1921), the criteria of contemporary binding international definition of the national park.</p> -->

          <p class="lead">Białowieża Forest is a natural habitat for the large, as for our climatic sphere, number of animal species. Starting from invertabrates: protozoans, platyhelminths, nematodes, hairybacks (gastrotrich), molluscs, worms, tardigrades, spiders, mites, centepedes, insects and many more, and finishing with vertebrates: fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals – until today there have been over 12 thousand species identified in Białowieża Forest. In Poland there are approximately 35-40 thousand of animal species. According to the estimations, the forest fauna is defined only in 50%, thus the actual amount of species living in the forest might reach even 25 thousand.</p>

The degree of their recognition probably do not exceed 50%. Due to that fact, almost every year new animal species are being discovered with the aim of enriching our country’s fauna and with the aim of bringing a contribution to the science. Many of the animals, which can be found in the forest, have here their only, or one of just few habitats worldwide. Referring to the newly discovered species it is hard to specify their population.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Lynx</h2>
          <p class="lead">The Eurasian lynx inhabits rugged forested country providing plenty of hideouts and stalking opportunities. Depending on the locality, this may include forest-steppe, boreal forest, and montane forest. In the more mountainous parts of their range, Eurasian lynx will descend into the lowlands in winter, following their prey, and avoiding the deepest snows. They tend to be less common where wolves are abundant, and wolves have been reported to attack and even eat lynx. In Russian forests, the most important predators of the Eurasian lynx are the grey wolf. Wolves kill and eat lynxes that fail to escape into trees. Lynx populations decrease when wolves appear in a region and are likely to take smaller prey where wolves are active. Wolverines are perhaps the most dogged of competitors for kills, often stealing lynx kills. Lynxes tend to actively avoid encounters with wolverines, but may sometimes fight them if defending kittens. In one case in Sweden, one (a "young male") of 33 dead lynxes appeared to be preyed upon by a wolverine with another known instance of predation by an adult wolverine on an adult lynx was seen in the Pechora River area. There are no known instances of lynx preying on a wolverine. Sometimes, Siberian tigers have also preyed on lynxes, as evidenced by examination of tiger stomach contents. Lynx compete for food with the predators described above, and also with the red fox, eagle owls, golden eagles, wild boar (which scavenge from lynx kills), and in the southern part of its range, the snow leopard and leopard as well.</p>

          <p class="lead">It is the largest of the spotted woodpeckers in the western Palearctic, 24–26 cm long with wing-span 38–40 cm and has plumage similar to the great spotted woodpecker, but with white bars across the wings rather than spots, and a white lower back. The male has a red crown, the female a black one.</p>
          <p class="lead">The nominate race D. l. leucotos occurs in central and northern Europe, with the race D. l. lilfordi found in the Balkans and Turkey. Ten further races occur in the region eastwards as far as Korea and Japan. It is a scarce bird, requiring large tracts of mature deciduous forests with high amounts of standing and laying dead wood. Numbers have decreased in Nordic countries. In Sweden, its population decline has caused the Swedish government to enact protection for the species in the national Biodiversity Action Plan. In the breeding season it excavates a nest hole about 7 cm wide and 30 cm deep in a decaying tree trunk. It lays three to five white eggs and incubates for 10–11 days. It lives predominantly on wood-boring beetles as well as their larvae, as well as other insects, nuts, seeds and berries. Drumming by males is very loud, calls include a soft kiuk and a longer kweek.</p>

Several lineages of frogs among the Neobatrachia have given rise to tree frogs, although they are not closely related to each other.Many millions of years of convergent evolution have resulted in almost identical morphology and ecologies. They are so similar as regards their ecological niche that in one biome where one group of tree frogs occurs, the other is almost always absent. The last common ancestor of some such tree frog groups lived long before the extinction of the dinosaurs.</p>
